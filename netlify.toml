# This configuration file is for Netlify.

# The following rule is crucial for Single Page Applications (SPAs) like React.
# It tells Netlify that for any request path that doesn't match a file on the server,
# it should serve the `index.html` file instead of returning a 404 error.
# The JavaScript router will then take over and display the correct component based on the URL.
